This is a simple game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Rules are simple and the game it's self explanatory.
You pick a number from 1 to 20 and the game hint displays whether the umber is too high or too low,
compared to the correct number. Depending on how long it takes you to find the correct number, you are given a a score and a highscore. The score resets when you click "AGAIN" so you can try to beat your highscore! :)
